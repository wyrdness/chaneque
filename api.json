      "full": "Chaneques are small humanoid nature spirits from Mexican indigenous folklore, particularly Aztec and pre-Columbian traditions. Described as childlike beings standing 2-3 feet tall, they serve as guardians and protectors of forests, animals, and natural resources. Chaneques are known for their mischievous and sometimes dangerous behavior—they can cause illness or madness, steal souls (particularly of children), and lead people astray in forests. Traditional beliefs are strongest in Oaxaca, Veracruz, and indigenous communities throughout Mexico. Their behavior includes leading travelers astray, punishing those who harm nature, and acting as guardians against overexploitation of natural resources. Modern sightings continue in rural Mexico where indigenous communities maintain these beliefs. Chaneques are related to duendes, fairies, nature spirits, and elemental beings from other cultures. They serve an important cultural function as environmental protection folklore and cautionary tales."
